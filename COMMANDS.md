# Bob Command Reference

> **GENERATED — do not hand-edit.** Regenerate with `node scripts/generate-command-reference.cjs`.
> One row per emitted command, derived from the `commands/gsd/*.md` source set and filtered
> through the same bob-adapter gate the roster uses. Each description is lifted VERBATIM from
> the source frontmatter `description:` field, so this reference cannot silently drift from
> what actually installs (D-02). The set-equality drift guard `test/docs-conformance.test.cjs`
> pins this list to the generated `SUPPORT-ROSTER.md` Supported set.
