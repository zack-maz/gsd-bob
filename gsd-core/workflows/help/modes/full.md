# GSD Core Command Reference

**GSD Core** (Git. Ship. Done.) creates hierarchical project plans optimized for solo agentic development with Claude Code.

## Quick Start

1. `/gsd-new-project` - Initialize project (includes research, requirements, roadmap)
2. `/gsd-plan-phase 1` - Create detailed plan for first phase
3. `/gsd-execute-phase 1` - Execute the phase

## Staying Updated

GSD evolves fast. Update periodically:

```bash
npx @opengsd/gsd-core@latest
```

## Core Workflow

```text
/gsd-new-project → /gsd-plan-phase → /gsd-execute-phase → repeat
```

### Project Initialization

**`/gsd-new-project`**
Initialize new project through unified flow.

One command takes you from idea to ready-for-planning:
- Deep questioning to understand what you're building
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with v1/v2/out-of-scope scoping
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown and success criteria

Creates all `.planning/` artifacts:
- `PROJECT.md` — vision and requirements
- `config.json` — workflow mode (interactive/yolo)
- `research/` — domain research (if selected)
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements with REQ-IDs
- `ROADMAP.md` — phases mapped to requirements
- `STATE.md` — project memory

Usage: `/gsd-new-project`

**`/gsd:map-codebase [--fast] [--focus <area>] [--query <term>]`**
Map an existing codebase for brownfield projects.

- `--fast` — rapid lightweight assessment (replaces the former `gsd-scan`)
- `--focus <area>` — scope the map to a specific area
- `--query <term>` — query the codebase intelligence index in `.planning/intel/` (replaces the former `gsd-intel`)

- Analyzes codebase with parallel Explore agents
- Creates `.planning/codebase/` with 7 focused documents
- Covers stack, architecture, structure, conventions, testing, integrations, concerns
- Use before `/gsd-new-project` on existing codebases

Usage: `/gsd:map-codebase`

### Phase Planning

**`/gsd-discuss-phase <number> [--chain | --analyze | --power | --assumptions] [--batch[=N]]`**
Help articulate your vision for a phase before planning.

- `--chain` — chained-prompt discuss flow
- `--analyze` — deep assumption analysis pass
- `--power` — power-user mode with extended question set
- `--assumptions` — surface Claude's implementation assumptions about the phase without an interactive session

- Captures how you imagine this phase working
- Creates CONTEXT.md with your vision, essentials, and boundaries
- Use when you have ideas about how something should look/feel
- Optional `--batch` asks 2-5 related questions at a time instead of one-by-one

Usage: `/gsd-discuss-phase 2`
Usage: `/gsd-discuss-phase 2 --batch`
Usage: `/gsd-discuss-phase 2 --batch=3`

**`/gsd-plan-phase <number> [--research] [--skip-research] [--research-phase <N>] [--view] [--gaps] [--skip-verify] [--prd <file>] [--ingest <path-or-glob>] [--ingest-format <auto|nygard|madr|narrative>] [--reviews] [--text] [--tdd] [--mvp]`**
Create detailed execution plan for a specific phase.

- `--skip-research` — bypass the research subagent
- `--research-phase <N>` — research-only mode. Spawns the research agent for phase `<N>`, writes `RESEARCH.md`, then exits before the planner runs. Useful for cross-phase research, doc review before committing to a planning approach, and correction-without-replanning loops. Replaces the deleted `gsd-research-phase` standalone command (#3042).
  - Modifiers: `--research` forces refresh (re-spawn researcher). `--view` prints existing `RESEARCH.md` to stdout without spawning. With neither, auto-uses an existing `RESEARCH.md` (one-line notice, then clean exit).
- `--gaps` — focus only on closing gaps from a prior plan-check
- `--skip-verify` — skip the post-plan verifier loop
- `--ingest <path-or-glob>` — pre-ingest external ADRs/PRDs/SPECs before planning (see *PRD Express Path* below)
- `--ingest-format <auto|nygard|madr|narrative>` — hint the ADR ingester's parser when `--ingest` is set; defaults to `auto`
- `--tdd` — plan in test-driven order (tests before code)
- `--mvp` — vertical-slice MVP planning mode (see also `/gsd:mvp-phase`)

- Generates `.planning/phases/XX-phase-name/XX-YY-PLAN.md`
- Breaks phase into concrete, actionable tasks
- Includes verification criteria and success measures
- Multiple plans per phase supported (XX-01, XX-02, etc.)

Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase 1`
Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase --research-phase 2` — research only on phase 2 (auto-uses existing `RESEARCH.md`, no prompt)
Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase --research-phase 2 --view` — print existing `RESEARCH.md`, no spawn
Usage: `/gsd-plan-phase --research-phase 2 --research` — force-refresh, no prompt
Result: Creates `.planning/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`

**PRD Express Path:** Pass `--prd path/to/requirements.md` to skip discuss-phase entirely. Your PRD becomes locked decisions in CONTEXT.md. Useful when you already have clear acceptance criteria.

### Execution

**`/gsd-execute-phase <phase-number> [--wave N] [--gaps-only] [--tdd]`**
Execute all plans in a phase, or run a specific wave.

- `--wave N` — execute only wave N (see *Plans within each wave* below)
- `--gaps-only` — re-run only plans flagged as gaps by a prior verifier
- `--tdd` — enforce test-driven order during execution

- Groups plans by wave (from frontmatter), executes waves sequentially
- Plans within each wave run in parallel via Task tool
- Optional `--wave N` flag executes only Wave `N` and stops unless the phase is now fully complete
- Verifies phase goal after all plans complete
- Updates REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md

Usage: `/gsd-execute-phase 5`
Usage: `/gsd-execute-phase 5 --wave 2`

### Smart Router

**`/gsd-progress --do "<description>"`**
Route freeform text to the right GSD command automatically.

- Analyzes natural language input to find the best matching GSD command
- Acts as a dispatcher — never does the work itself
- Resolves ambiguity by asking you to pick between top matches
- Use when you know what you want but don't know which `/gsd-*` command to run

Usage: `/gsd-progress --do "fix the login button"`
Usage: `/gsd-progress --do "refactor the auth system"`
Usage: `/gsd-progress --do "I want to start a new milestone"`

### Quick Mode

**`/gsd:quick [--full] [--validate] [--discuss] [--research]`**
Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees but skip optional agents.

Quick mode uses the same system with a shorter path:
- Spawns planner + executor (skips researcher, checker, verifier by default)
- Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases
- Updates STATE.md tracking (not ROADMAP.md)

Flags enable additional quality steps:
- `--full` — Complete quality pipeline: discussion + research + plan-checking + verification
- `--validate` — Plan-checking (max 2 iterations) and post-execution verification only
- `--discuss` — Lightweight discussion to surface gray areas before planning
- `--research` — Focused research agent investigates approaches before planning

Granular flags are composable: `--discuss --research --validate` gives the same as `--full`.

Usage: `/gsd:quick`
Usage: `/gsd:quick --full`
Usage: `/gsd:quick --research --validate`
Result: Creates `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/PLAN.md`, `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/NNN-slug-SUMMARY.md`

---

**`/gsd:fast [description]`**
Execute a trivial task inline — no subagents, no planning files, no overhead.

For tasks too small to justify planning: typo fixes, config changes, forgotten commits, simple additions. Runs in the current context, makes the change, commits, and logs to STATE.md.

- No PLAN.md or SUMMARY.md created
- No subagent spawned (runs inline)
- ≤ 3 file edits — redirects to `/gsd:quick` if task is non-trivial
- Atomic commit with conventional message

Usage: `/gsd:fast "fix the typo in README"`
Usage: `/gsd:fast "add .env to gitignore"`

### Roadmap Management

**`/gsd:phase <description>`**
Add new phase to end of current milestone.

- Appends to ROADMAP.md
- Uses next sequential number
- Updates phase directory structure

Usage: `/gsd:phase "Add admin dashboard"`

**`/gsd:phase --insert <after> <description>`**
Insert urgent work as decimal phase between existing phases.

- Creates intermediate phase (e.g., 7.1 between 7 and 8)
- Useful for discovered work that must happen mid-milestone
- Maintains phase ordering

Usage: `/gsd:phase --insert 7 "Fix critical auth bug"`
Result: Creates Phase 7.1

**`/gsd:phase --remove <number>`**
Remove a future phase and renumber subsequent phases.

- Deletes phase directory and all references
- Renumbers all subsequent phases to close the gap
- Only works on future (unstarted) phases
- Git commit preserves historical record

Usage: `/gsd:phase --remove 17`
Result: Phase 17 deleted, phases 18-20 become 17-19

**`/gsd:phase --edit <number> [--force]`**
Edit any field of an existing roadmap phase in place, preserving number and position.

- Updates title, description, requirements, dependencies in `ROADMAP.md`
- `--force` allows editing already-started phases (use with caution)

Start a new milestone through unified flow.

- Deep questioning to understand what you're building next
- Optional domain research (spawns 4 parallel researcher agents)
- Requirements definition with scoping
- Roadmap creation with phase breakdown
- Optional `--reset-phase-numbers` flag restarts numbering at Phase 1 and archives old phase dirs first for safety

Mirrors `/gsd-new-project` flow for brownfield projects (existing PROJECT.md).

Usage: `/gsd:new-milestone "v2.0 Features"`
Usage: `/gsd:new-milestone --reset-phase-numbers "v2.0 Features"`

Check project status and intelligently route to next action.

- Shows visual progress bar and completion percentage
- Summarizes recent work from SUMMARY files
- Displays current position and what's next
- Lists key decisions and open issues
- Offers to execute next plan or create it if missing
- Detects 100% milestone completion

Modes:
- **default** — progress report + intelligent routing
- **`--next`** — auto-advance to the next logical step (use `--next --force` to bypass safety gates)
- **`--next --auto`** — like `--next`, but chains steps automatically until milestone completion or a blocking decision
- **`--next --converge`** — when the next action is planning, route it through `/gsd:plan-review-convergence` instead of `/gsd-plan-phase`; requires `workflow.plan_review_convergence=true`. `--cross-ai` is an alias. Reviewer flags (`--codex`, `--gemini`, `--claude`, `--opencode`, `--ollama`, `--lm-studio`, `--llama-cpp`, `--all`) and `--max-cycles N` forward to the convergence loop.
- **`--forensic`** — append a 6-check integrity audit after the progress report

- **`/gsd:workspace [--new | --list | --remove] [name]`** — Manage GSD workspaces: create, list, or remove isolated workspace environments.
- **`/gsd:workstreams`** — Manage parallel workstreams: list, create, switch, status, progress, complete, and resume.
- **`/gsd:review-backlog`** — Review and promote backlog items to active milestone.
- **`/gsd:milestone-summary [version]`** — Generate a comprehensive project summary from milestone artifacts for team onboarding and review.

### Repository Integration

- **`/gsd:inbox [--issues] [--prs] [--label] [--close-incomplete] [--repo owner/repo]`** — Triage and review open GitHub issues and PRs against project templates and contribution guidelines.

### Namespace Routers (model-facing meta-skills)

These six skills exist primarily for the model to perform two-stage hierarchical routing across 60+ skills. You can invoke them directly when you want to browse a category interactively.

- **`/gsd-context`** — Codebase intelligence routing (map, graphify, docs, learnings, mempalace).
- **`/gsd-ideate`** — Exploration / capture routing (explore, sketch, spike, spec, capture).
- **`/gsd-manage`** — Configuration and workspace routing (workstreams, thread, update, ship, inbox).
- **`/gsd-project`** — Project-lifecycle routing (milestones, audits, summary).
- **`/gsd-quality`** — Quality-gate routing (code review, debug, audit, security, eval, ui).
- **`/gsd-workflow`** — Phase-pipeline routing (discuss, plan, execute, verify, phase, progress).

## Workflow Modes

Set during `/gsd-new-project`:

**Interactive Mode**

- Confirms each major decision
- Pauses at checkpoints for approval
- More guidance throughout

**YOLO Mode**

- Auto-approves most decisions
- Executes plans without confirmation
- Only stops for critical checkpoints

Change anytime by editing `.planning/config.json`

## Planning Configuration

Configure how planning artifacts are managed in `.planning/config.json`:

**`planning.commit_docs`** (default: `true`)
- `true`: Planning artifacts committed to git (standard workflow)
- `false`: Planning artifacts kept local-only, not committed

When `commit_docs: false`:
- Add `.planning/` to your `.gitignore`
- Useful for OSS contributions, client projects, or keeping planning private
- All planning files still work normally, just not tracked in git

**`planning.search_gitignored`** (default: `false`)
- `true`: Add `--no-ignore` to broad ripgrep searches
- Only needed when `.planning/` is gitignored and you want project-wide searches to include it

Example config:
```json
{
  "planning": {
    "commit_docs": false,
    "search_gitignored": true
  }
}
```

## Common Workflows

**Starting a new project:**

```text
/gsd-new-project        # Unified flow: questioning → research → requirements → roadmap
/clear
/gsd-plan-phase 1       # Create plans for first phase
/clear
/gsd-execute-phase 1    # Execute all plans in phase
```

**Resuming work after a break:**

```text
/gsd-progress  # See where you left off and continue
```

**Adding urgent mid-milestone work:**

```text
/gsd:phase --insert 5 "Critical security fix"
/gsd-plan-phase 5.1
/gsd-execute-phase 5.1
```

**Completing a milestone:**

```text
/gsd:complete-milestone 1.0.0
/clear
/gsd:new-milestone  # Start next milestone (questioning → research → requirements → roadmap)
```

**Capturing ideas during work:**

```text
/gsd:capture                                  # Capture from conversation context
/gsd:capture Fix modal z-index                # Capture with explicit description
/gsd:capture --note refactor auth system      # Quick friction-free note
/gsd:capture --seed "real-time notifications" # Forward-looking idea with triggers
/gsd:capture --list                           # Review and work on todos
/gsd:capture --list api                       # Filter by area
```

**Debugging an issue:**

```text
/gsd-debug "form submission fails silently"  # Start debug session
# ... investigation happens, context fills up ...
/clear
/gsd-debug                                    # Resume from where you left off
```

## Getting Help

- Read `.planning/PROJECT.md` for project vision
- Read `.planning/STATE.md` for current context
- Check `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for phase status
- Run `/gsd-progress` to check where you're up to
